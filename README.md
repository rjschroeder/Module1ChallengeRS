### PROJECT: Module 1 assignment

## This module delivered the following user story: 

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## This module delivered the following acceptance criteria:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

### DESCRIPTION:

After assessing what needed to be changed, first I replaced the existing title of the website.
I chose its new title simply from the other information provided on the website.

Next, I decided to add alt text to the images. After opening each one, I included a short description of what the images
were as if I were describing it to someone who could not see it at all.

Next, I checked that the heading elements were in order.
